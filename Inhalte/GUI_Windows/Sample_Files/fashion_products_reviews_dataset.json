It is so incredibly soft, while also being warm but not bulky at all (which is one of my least favorite things about sweatshirts). They didn't have my size, so I went a size up and it's not too bad at all. It hangs nicely, and still looks nice. My 7-year-old actually stole it from me and wore it over some leggings and loves it. I had to sneak it back since she loves it so much. The picture is of the inside, because it feels amazing. The fleece is so soft, but so is the outside.

The cold generally doesn't bother young blood, but folks that are older and getting on, the cold winter outdoors are felt more.</p><p>Wearing these thermal compression bottoms underneath jeans or trousers is almost like having a second skin, as it contours around the legs keeping heat loss to a minimum which is the main feature described. The inner side has flatlock seams and feels fleecy and soft reducing irritation and discomfort. It is also breathable and wicks away any sweat by absorbing, and helps that it has anti-odor attributes as well. What makes it comfortable is that it is stretchy in all directions so it doesn't feel tight because of the spandex properties but does feel snug and comfy with no restrictions to movement. For blokes, the open fly makes bathroom visits a tad easier altho it's obviously another layer to get to.</p><p>Overall, it's snuggly, extremely lightweight, comfy, and stretchy. With these underneath you can embrace and endure the harsh cold winter days and get on with your day without being uncomfortable. Highly recommend these thermal bottoms. Just need to get a matching thermal top to go with these bottoms for total comfort.</p></div>", "average_rating": "4.6", "review_heading": "Comfy thermal bottoms", "product_url": "https://www.walmart.com/ip/644640218", "review_page_url": "https://www.walmart.com/reviews/product/644640218", "rating": "5.0", "images": "http://i5.walmartimages.com/dfw/6e29e393-2f43/k2-_8d4528af-3bde-437c-bace-c318bbef1e88.v1.jpg?odnWidth=100&odnHeight=100&odnBg=000 ~ http://i5.walmartimages.com/dfw/6e29e393-1f07/k2-_39fd2814-c58b-4eab-8363-784bfa337eb9.v1.jpg?odnWidth=100&odnHeight=100&odnBg=000"},

These fit very well, almost like a second skin, but giving as needed. There is no bulk to them and the material allowed my body to retain the heat outside, but release it whenever I went into a building or it warmed up closer to 50 degrees. I would suggest that you wear no other undergarments, as it would defeat the purpose of trying to lose the bulk, maintain a balanced temperature, and most undergarments would impact the comfortability of the pants. They are exceptional soft, both inside and out. I washed them six times, with no negative effect on the material and it's wearing comfort. It has a great blend of 92% ultra-soft polyester and 8% spandex. The elastic waistband is very stretch, but comfortable. When ordering, I suggest you order by length, more so than by waistline. I've included a picture to help you see what a Large size measures out to be after six washings; the spandex really allows it to stretch out for your waist and leg size, not so much the length. Get the size larger if you are concerned, but the length may be not to your liking; I wish they posted the inseam length. My Large measured: Waist 15 - 22\", Length top to bottom 36\", and Inseam length 25\". They also handwash up easily, fast air drying, and pack up to the size a bit larger than a softball.
